# Study Timer

A modern, aesthetic floating study timer designed to help you track your study sessions on **Physics Wallah**.  
The timer **starts automatically** when the Physics Wallah tab is active in your browser and **pauses** when you switch tabs. You can also **manually start and stop** the timer anytime.  

This project combines **Python PyQt5** for a sleek floating GUI and **Flask** for backend API communication with a **Chrome/Brave extension** that monitors your active tabs.
